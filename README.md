What does K mean clustering mean?
 K Means Numerical Example. The primary step of k-means clustering is simple. In the beginning, we determine the number of clusters K and assume the centroid or centre 
 of these clusters. We can take any random objects as the initial centroids or the first K objects in sequence can also serve as the initial centroids.
